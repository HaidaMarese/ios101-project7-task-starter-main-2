## Notes

Challenges encountered during development: 
-[ ] Setting up tab bar navigation was a bit challenging because I had to ensure smooth transition between the tasks and calendar views.

-[ ] Ensuring that updates to tasks on the main screen also reflected on the calendar view required proper synchronization between the views.
